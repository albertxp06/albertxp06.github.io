                <p>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space at the Unviersity of California, San Diego, or SEDS UCSD, is a aerospace club for students interested in shaping the future of space exploration and travel. Beginning as an eight member club, they rapidly achieved fame by becoming <em>the</em> first student organization to design, print, and test a 3D-printed rocket engine. The club rapidly grew, reaching nearly 100 members at its peak. There was a lot of information to keep track of, including research, member information, and contacts. 
                </p>
                <p>While Google Drive was sufficient to keep tabs on information at first, the amount of information quickly grew out of hand, and they needed a more efficient and organized method to store information. </p>

                <p>SEDS UCSD began with a spreadsheet containing every member's information, from phone numbers and email to birthdays and citizenship status. Over the years, through multiple leadership changes due to graduation, the sheet slowly became a Frankenstein of organization and information.</p>

                <p>Artemis initially began as two separate platforms: 
                  <ol> 
                    <li>Attendance for SEDS UCSD, a simple timecard system with clock in and clock out functionality to keep track of member participation and activity during work (or build) days.</li>
                    <li>Members SEDS UCSD, a simple member information database. </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>When the time came to create an integrated system, I quickly realized that merging Attendance and Members would be messy and time consuming. The two systems relied on different database structures with different stylings and mixed MySQL and PHP versions. It would be more beneficial to create a new playform with capabilities beyond the previous two.</p> 

                <p>It began with asking the team leads what they would like out of a single system. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>What do you like/dislike the most about the spreadsheet of information?</li>
                    <li>What would you like to see in terms of keeping information updated?</li>
                    <li>And a very broad: what else would you like to be included in the platform?</li>
                  </ul>
