                <p>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space at the Unviersity of California, San Diego, or SEDS UCSD, is a aerospace club for students interested in shaping the future of space exploration and travel. Beginning as an eight member club, they rapidly achieved fame by becoming <em>the</em> first student organization to design, print, and test a 3D-printed rocket engine. The club rapidly grew, reaching nearly 100 members at its peak. There was a lot of information to keep track of, including research, member information, and contacts. 
                </p>
                <p>While Google Drive was sufficient to keep tabs on information at first, the amount of information quickly grew out of hand, and they needed a more efficient and organized method to store information. </p>

                <p>SEDS UCSD began with a spreadsheet containing every member's information, from phone numbers and email to birthdays and citizenship status. Over the years, through multiple leadership changes due to graduation, the sheet slowly became a Frankenstein of organization and information.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <h1>Concept and Design</h1>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12 pt-10">
                
                <p>Artemis initially began as two separate platforms: 
                  <ol> 
                    <li>Attendance for SEDS UCSD, a simple timecard system with clock in and clock out functionality to keep track of member participation and activity during work (or build) days.</li>
                    <li>Members SEDS UCSD, a simple member information database. </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>When the time came to create an integrated system, I quickly realized that merging Attendance and Members would be messy and time consuming. The two systems relied on different database structures with different stylings and mixed MySQL and PHP versions. It would be more beneficial to create a new playform with capabilities beyond the previous two.</p> 

                <p>It began with asking the team leads what they would like out of a single system. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>What do you like/dislike the most about the spreadsheet of information?</li>
                    <li>What would you like to see in terms of keeping information updated?</li>
                    <li>And a very broad: what else would you like to be included in the platform?</li>
                  </ul>

                </p> 

                <p>
                	It became immeditaely obvious that the officers wanted a clean, easy to use and update method of storing member information. Club members needed a way to quickly clock in and out of the time card and view their status within the club (e.g. dues paid or whether or not they have signed the NDA).
                </p> 
                <p>
                	I decided not to start from scratch and create my own design. Instead, I chose an admin templaye and decided to modify it. Why spend time making something when there are hundreds of viable and tested options out there? The template also includes mayn jQuery and Javascript libraries, that add functionality to the web page such as automatically creating searchable, sortable, and paginated tables. 
                </p> 

                <h3>The Front-End / UI</h3>
                <p>The interface needs to be mobile friendly, load quickly, and be fast to use. The log in screen is as simple as it could be. 
                	While the home page differs slightly between admin users and regular members, "Clock In" is still on the home page, being quick to access. Many pages went through multiple refreshes, to ensure that actions and data is placed in the optimal locations and that there isn't too much hunting.

                <h3>The Back-End / Guts</h3>
                <p>The new trend is that servers are beignning to be based on Node.JS and its related frameworks (e.g. React and Angular). While I had some familiarity with it, I decided to rely on PHP and MySQL, from which Attendance and Members were both made from. It was proven to work in real-life scenarios and allowed use of similar code. 
                </p>
                <p>To reduce the complexity and potential blocking of cookie storing, Artemis relies on PHP sessions, which are automatically stored on the server and allow users to skip the login screen if they have logged in recently on that device. Each page will repopulate user status and information in case their information (such as Admin or Member status) has been updated by another Admin.

                <p>There were a lot of things that could be improved on. I could have used better, more secure database structure. To prevent MySQL injections, I could have used PDO instead of relying on standard mysqli queries. In general, all the input fields need to be better sanitized before being processed. Additionally, I could have used more AJAX queries to keep users in the same place, especially when dealing with multiple in-page tabs that have tables. </p>
